            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>As by many other iuſt titles, ſo I am yours by this in particular of the laſt of Octob. for that you haue bene pleaſed thereby to ſignifie what paſſes at S. Germains, and that you ſo truly reſent the wrong which is done to Truth in the proclaiming of victories (eſpecially by ſuch, as you expreſſe it, as are not guiltie of too much vnderſtanding) gayned by the Lord of London-Derrie, D. Coſens (and who not?) ouer all the Papiſt Prieſts they meete withall: bearing all downe before them, as they pleaſe to tearme it. Sir, I am eaſily perſuaded to beleeue, that the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſuch vntruths were not verie vnderſtanding indeed, and that they ſpake accordingly. For I my ſelfe am wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:36392:3"/>that the Lord of London-Derrie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and fairely denyed that there were any ſuch reports occaſioned by him, or that indeed there was any ſuch cauſe: and I am much miſtaken, if D. Coſens be found ſo little ingenuous, as to abett ſo abſolute an vntruth. For ſure, he mett with none weaker then my ſelfe, and yet, to ſpeake ſparingly, he bore no aduantage away; as I hope this ſca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tling <hi>Of prayers to Angels,</hi> which I haue vnder his owne ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (&amp; ſome other occaſionall diſcourſes which he will not deny) will partly make good. At leaſt I moſt willingly leaue it to the indifferent reader to iudge of the Lion, <hi>ex illo vngue,</hi> rather then to haue Truth ſuffer through my ſilence, where my weake endeauours might be able to contribute any thing to its libertie and luſter. Certainly my labour therein was not ſo much to anſwer diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, as to diſcouer corruptions, miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings of, and violence made againſt the Authours genuine ſenſe, which being once diſcouered, the former ſeeming difficulties vanished of themſelues, Sir, if you doe me that right, (which I eaſily promiſe my ſelfe from your frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship, yea euen your iuſtice)
<pb facs="tcp:36392:3"/>as to conceiue I vſe candor herein, and ſpeake but a meaſured truth; you will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire with me, how this could be made a ſubiect of triumph and glorie. Thus farre to my friend then. Now to euery courteous Reader, I haue this humble ſuite to make, that, while he heares <hi>corruptions, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings of, and viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces made againſt the genuine ſenſe of the Authours,</hi> he permit not his iudgement to be foreſtalled with a preiudicate opinion, that theſe words are but the effects of paſsion: but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarily that without paſsion or preoccupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he would haue patience to reade and iudge: and if he finde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not reall truthes, no falſe aſperſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, let me paſſe for an impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour: But if truthes indeede; let truth be published, vindicated and knowen; let me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be our friends, but let Truth be incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably more our friend; let the Fathers be heard ſpeaking their owne ſenſe without force, that ſtreames of honie may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed from them into the hearts of the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, not ſtraynes of poyſon; And let ſuch as vſe violence againſt it know, <hi>that Truth for a tyme may be clouded, but cannot be ouercome: That ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
<pb facs="tcp:36392:4"/>for a tyme may flourish, but cannot be permanent;</hi> Finally, that no victorie is more glorious, then to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued by Truth. <hi>Superet igitur Veritas volentem, nam &amp; inuitum ipſa ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabit.</hi>

                     <p>Nor doth this paſſage of Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret any whit preiudice the Catholike cauſe, all things being well ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Firſt, becauſe his ſenſe herein is the ſenſe of the Councell, which you ſee toucheth vs not. Secondly his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36392:10"/>words being duely conſidered, they figh not with a Catholike procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; for he imputes onely the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Angels as a vice to thoſe who did it vpon this motiue, that they deliuered the law <hi>(telling them that the law was giuen by Angels, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ought to be worshipped)</hi> which is no Catholike ground of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship: and againe <hi>in that they ſaid the God of heauen and earth was inuiſible and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible,</hi> to whom they could not come, and therfore they ought to procure his fauour by the Angels. As though, forſouth, Gods inuiſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and incomprehenſibilitie were the true reaſon concluding that man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not approach him, and that therfore we were neceſſitated to procure ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe by the Angells fauour: which is a dreame falling into no Catholike heart: For though we willingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that the mediation of Angels and Saints is good, holy, vſefull, and alwayes vſuall in the Church of God, yet is it not vpon a miſtaken ground, that there is no other way to gett ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36392:10"/>to him. We know that by the feete of heauenly Loue we are able to walke home to that inuiſible and incomprehenſible Deitie; which Loue is heard, though the Angels were euen ſilent, and is not refuſed entrie. So that the mediation of Angels is neither neceſſarie for that reaſon, nor indeed (for any thing I haue yet bene taught) neceſſarie at all, by an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſitie obliging euery one in particular. The words of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Trent being theſe: <hi>that it is good and profitable humbly to call vpon them, &amp;c. and to flie to their prayers helpe and aſsiſtance, &amp;c.</hi> not that that is the onely meanes to approach vnto God, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>I anſwere ſecondly that here againe is a whole clauſe left out, whence the clearing of the difficultie was to be demanded to witt, <hi>(As Parmenianus in a certaine place put a Bishop Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour betwixt the people and God.)</hi> And how did Parmenianus put Bishops Mediatours &amp;c? marrie, as purifiers and iuſtifiers of men by their owne vertue and iuſtice, ſince they (the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts) allowed vertue and effect to the Sacraments and Sacrifice onely according to the qualitie of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter or offerer, which was indeed to aſſume to themſelues the proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Chriſt Ieſus who onely of himſelfe is able to appeaſe Gods wrath againſt ſinne, as being our principal, immediate, primarie Mediatour and indeed our onely Mediatour of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, who by the right of his owne merits obtaynes grace forvs: the others onely by him and by his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Such a Mediatour it is manifeſt S. Aug. ſpake of in this place (and ſuch we admitt none but Chriſt alone) who
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:36392:23"/>ſpake againſt the pride of the Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, which forſoothe would haue <hi>no ſpott or vice to be amongſt them or their fellowes,</hi> as ſaith S. Auguſtine in the chap. immediately before, which was a prerogatiue due to Chriſt alone, <hi>who was that one and true Mediatour for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none prayed, &amp; he prayed for all,</hi> as ſaith the ſaid St. in this 8. chap. In fine one of S. Auguſtines principall deſignes in this place was to proue againſt the Donatiſts that they iniuſtly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated themſelues from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church vpon pretence of the wickednes of the Bishops and prieſts in the Church: for, <hi>dato</hi> that it were ſo indeed, yet were that no iuſt cauſe of a diuiſion or ſchiſme; ſince (be the Bishops and prieſts what they will) we <hi>ought alwayes to be ſecure of one Mediatour,</hi> Ieſus Chriſt the iuſt, whom we haue an Aduocate with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and he is the propitiation for our ſinnes.

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36392:24"/>that the Catholike Church in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king her true miracles did not vſe their proceeding in working falſe ones (which they did by the inuoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſuperſtitious naming of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, to whom they aſcribed the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world) by incantations and ſpells whereby they deluded ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, eſpecially poore women, robbing them of fortunes and honour, with the exerciſe of innumerable villanies (as is to be ſeene in the 9. 20. 22. and and 24. chapters of his firſt booke) but by faſting and prayer performed chaſtely, purely, openly, and without hope of lucre.

                        <hi>THey that neglect to come vnto God himſelfe, and goe to him by others, vſe to make this miſerable excuſe, that by the helpe of others they can come to God, as by the helpe of noble men they can come to the king. Goe to, It is treaſon to take the honour or Maieſtie of a king, and to giue it to a Lord. And doe theſe men thinke to eſcape, if they giue the honour of God to a creature and worship it? For therfore doe men goe to a king by great and noble perſonages, becauſe the king is no more then a man himſelfe. But to come to God (who knowes euery thing) and to procure his fauour there is no ſuch need of a helper or ſuffragator. For where euer any one will ſpeake (or pray) vnto him,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36392:31"/>he will himſelfe be readie to heare and anſwere him.</hi>

This place vpon the firſt ſight may ſeeme both liuely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, and at once to improue the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike cuſtome of making vſe of the Saints interceſſion to God. But truely were S.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36392:32"/>yet being ashamed of their neglect of God, they are wont to vſe this miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuſe, ſaying, that by thoſe,</hi> (to witt, fellow ſeruants or creatures whereof the ſpeech was before, and are after named <hi>conſerui</hi>) <hi>they are able to goe to God, as by the Countes they come to the king. Goe to, is any one ſo madd, or ſo vnmyndfull of his ſaluation, as that he would chalenge the honour of a king to a Count, ſith if euen any be but found to treate of his matter, they are iuſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned guiltie of treaſon? And theſe thinke not themſelues guiltie, who giue away the honour of Gods name to a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and forſaking the Lord and Maſter adore their fellow ſeruants, as though there were yet ſome further thing reſerued for God. For euen therfore it is that we goe to the king by the meanes of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes or Counts, becauſe indeed the king himſelfe is a man, and he knowes not in whoſe hands to intruſt the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth.

                     <p>In a word, this Authour is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the pagan Philoſophers, who knowing God did not worship him accordingly, but gaue away the honour due to him alone, to crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to ſtockes, ſtones, and ſtatuaes, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they called and honored as their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36392:33"/>gods, as is euident all through the chapter. In particular, where he ſaith. <hi>So was their heart blinded, that they changed the Maieſtie of the inuiſible God, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by theſe his workes they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, not into men, but (which is worſe, and euen a crime not to be excuſed) into the ſimilitude of men, that the forme of a corruptible man, that is the picture of man is by them tearmed their God, that ſo they may receaue the pictures of them being dead into the glorie of a God, to whom being aliue they durſt not aſcribe Deitie.</hi>

                     <p>And a little after. <hi>Changing the trueth of God into a lye, that they gaue the name of the true God, to thoſe wuich are not Gods: for taking from ſtones, wood, and other mettall, what they are indeed; they attribute to them what they are not, &amp;c. for they are not now called wood or ſtone, but God, and this is rather to ſerue the creature,</hi> (which is called aboue, their fellow ſeruant, and in that name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned) <hi>then the Creatour.</hi> So that it is manifeſt, that the Authour doth not at all in this paſſage, touch or point at, much leſſe reprehend or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36392:33"/>the Catholike practiſe of giuing an inferiour honour to the Saints; and praying to them to become interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours for vs: which will yet more clearely appeare to ſuch as will take the paynes to reade his booke <hi>de vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duis</hi> after the middeſt, where he ſaith. <hi>Peter and Andrew therfore prayed for the widow, I wish to God there were any ſo readie to pray for vs, at leaſt he who prayed for his mother in law, Peter, and Andrew his brother, They could then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate for affinities ſake, now they are able to doe it for vs and all men. You ſee that one ſubiect to a great ſinne, is leſſe fitt to pray, at leaſt to obtuyne for her ſelfe: Let her therfore imploye others to pray to the Phyſitian. For the ſicke are not able to pray for themſelues, vnles the Phyſitian by the intreatie of others be inuited to come to them. Flesh is infirme, the myned is ſicke, and hindred with the chaynes of ſinnes. It is not able to make one weake ſtepp towards the ſeate of that Phyſitia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. We muſt therfore heartely beſeech the Angels in our behalfe, who are giuen for our helpe, we must pray to the Martyrs, of whom we

Hence, ſuch towards the Emperours, as had the credit to giue their voyces, aduice or opinion tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the capacities or incapacities of perſons pretending preferments, were called ſuffragators, that is informers, helping to ſupplie the Emperours want of knowledge, of the merits or demerits of particular perſons ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36392:35"/>to beare office in the common wealth. And ſuch ſuffragators, ſaith the Authour and we with him, God needs none, ſith as is ſaid in the ſame place, <hi>For be knowes all mens merits: from whom nothing lyes hid,</hi> and ſo needs not any to informe him of the worth and abilities of his ſubiects, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours needed the aduice of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes or Gouernours of Prouinces, of the ſufficiencie of perſons within their precincts, and was inabled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcerne who, were fitt to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed.</p>

                     <p>To thinke to anſwer all that hath beneſaid, by oppoſing ſome few obſcure places cull'd out of the ſame Father: and ſo, (were it poſſible) to force him to contradict himſelfe, were in my iudgment, but verie bad payment. For firſt, this is not to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36392:57"/>produce euidences; but doubts; not to cleare, but to obſcure difficulties; and conſequently, ought to haue no force at all to thruſt a man out of his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. <hi>Poſsideo, quia poſsideo,</hi> ſtill dasheth ſuch weake oppoſition vpon the head. Secondly, it is but a poore shift, to make a Father ſeeme to ſtand up againſt himſelfe, to the end he may ſtand with them. Thirdly it is to treate a holy Father vnworthily, to endeauour to draw his ſenſe from his words,<note place="margin">In his booke de Doctrina Chriſtiana</note> againſt his owne rule, and the Rule of Reaſon, which is, that clearer places should illuſtrate obſcure pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; not that obſcure places should be induſtriouſly employed to clowde cleare places. That is but to put out the light, to ſee better; or rather to hate and flye the light, leaſt it might lay them naked, and they be diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by it. The worſt of arguments was wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be, to ayme to proue an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure thing, by a thing more obſcure; and yet it is farre worſe to darken a cleare thing by an obſcure, and yet (forſooth) thinke to haue ſo prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36392:57"/>a proceeding paſſe for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                     <p>Our proceeding is not ſuch: our Catholike cuſtome is to pray for; <hi>to make Commemoration of; to Sacrifice at the Altar for the ſoules departed that they may be releeued, or freed from their paines which are cauſed by fire, before the day of iudgement.</hi> And we bring in our iudge ſaint Auguſtine, to whom we haue both appealed, pronouncing ſentence for vs in tearmes, in the verie ſame wordes the Church doth beleeue and practiſe it. We doe not make his ſentence for him, but take from him, ſuch as he pleaſeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer it. We vſe no violence to him to make him ſpeake what we pleaſe, but we are well pleaſed with what he ſpeakes. we goe not about to ſurpriſe him, and wreſt a word from him, and then force it to our purpoſe, which was ſpoken only by the bye, while he was treating vpon another ſubiect. But wee take his iudgement from places, where, on ſett purpoſe, he is handling that ſubiect which is in
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36392:58"/>queſtion betwixt vs.</p>
                     <p>In fine, wee take it not from one or a fewe (which is another Rule of reaſon, to vnderſtand a fewe places by many places) but from abundance of places, all cleare and conſonant, and to the life expreſſing the preſent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Catholike Church.

                        <hi>In the bookes of the Machabees we reade that a ſacrifice was offered for the dead. Howbeit though it were not at all read in the ancient Scriptures, the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36392:60"/>of the vniuerſall Church which is euident in point of this cuſtome, is uo ſmall matter; where the commendation of the dead hath its proper place in the prayers of the prieſt, which are powred out to God at his Altar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here you will marke two things. The firſt is that ſaint Auguſtine eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the Machabees to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſince he argues for Purgatorie from it: and indeed he confirmes the ſame both in his ſeconde booke of Chriſtian Doctrine, the eight Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and alſo in his 18. booke of the Cittie of God 36. Chap. in theſe words. <hi>The bookes (to witt two) of the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees are held to be Canonicall, not by the Iewes, but by the Church.</hi> The ſeconde, that though there were no ſcripture for it, yet ought the authoritie of the <hi>vniuerſall Church</hi> to preuayle, at it doth in many other things of greater co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence. Witneſſe the ſaid Saint in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers paſſages, which both the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and Proteſtant doe admitt of.</p>
                     <p>For firſt,<note place="margin">Epiſt fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damen.</note> moued by the authoritie of the Church we beleeue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36392:60"/>it ſelfe, which without it we should not beleeue. <hi>I would not,</hi> ſaith he <hi>beleeue the Goſpell vnleſſe the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of the Catholike Church did moue me to it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, we beleeue many things which are not in the Scripture, as that the ſonne is conſubſtantiall with the Father: <hi>It is not found written in holy writt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and yet that it is ſaid, is defended in the aſſertion of faith.</hi> That the Father is vnbegotten. <hi>We read not in thoſe bookes</hi> (the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) <hi>that the Father is vnbegotten:</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>174.</hi>
                        </note> 
                        <hi>and yet we make good that we ought to ſay ſo:</hi> in the ſame place. That the Holy Ghoſt is to be adored: <hi>Giue me ſay you</hi> (he meanes Maximinus an Arrian) <hi>ſome teſtimonies where the Holy Ghoſt is adored: as though, forſooth,</hi> (replyes ſaint Auguſtine) <hi>out of theſe things which we reade, we vnderſtoode not alſo ſome things which we reade not.</hi> That it was written when the Apoſtle ſaint Paul was baptiſed, no mention being made of the reſt of the Apoſtles: <hi>It is written when the Apoſtle ſaint Paul
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36392:61"/>was baptiſed: and it is not written when the reſt of the Apoſtles were baptiſed: and yet we muſt vnderſtand that they alſo were baptiſed.</hi> Finally, that a child which cannot yet ſpeake, is ſaid to beleeue, and may be baptiſed. <hi>Be it farre from me to affirme that children beleeue not &amp;c. he beleeues in another, who offended in another. It is anſwered (dicitur) he beleeues: and it is of force: and he is numbred among the faithfull baptiſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>See what a neceſſitie is impoſed vpon all Chriſtians to haue ſome other infallible ground beſides Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to ſtand vpon, both to make good Scripture it ſelfe (to witt that it is the true word of God: that there are ſo many bookes of it and no more: that we haue the true ſenſe of it &amp;c.) and many other maine grounds of Chriſtianitie, which, you ſee, we dare not denye, while yet we can produce no formall ſcripture for them.

Auguſtins demaund was in matter of ceremonie, not of Faith: of particular obſeruance of a ſmall part of the Church, not of the generall gouernment of the whole, wherein the Popes ſupreme power is eſpecially and properly exerciſed and knowne. For theſe are the words of his third demaund. <hi>Why, there being but one faith, are the cuſtomes of Churches ſo diuers? And there is one cuſtome of Maſſes in the Romane Church, and another is obſerued in the Churches of France.</hi> So that it appeares euidently that ſaint Auguſtins demand to ſaint Gregorie was onely about the diuers cuſtomes of ſaying Maſſe (the verie word will hardly now be welcome) and was indeed like to that of Ianua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius to the great ſaint Auguſtine Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Church:<note place="margin">Epiſt. <hi>209.</hi>
                           </note> and ſaint Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries anſwer againe entirely conſonant to the great S. Auguſtines, ſpeaking of an indifferent, no neceſſarie obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.

                        <p>Saint Gregory. <hi>Your brotherhood is acquainted with the cuſtome of the Church, wherein you will remember you were bred. But it pleaſeth me, that if you haue found any thing, either in the holy Romane Church, that of France, or in what other ſoeuer, which may be more agreeable to Almightie God, you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully make choyce of it, and powre out by ſpeciall inſtitution, in the English Church (which is as yet young in faith) the choyceſt things which you can cull out of diuers Churches: for the things ought not to be loued in reſpect of the places, but the places by reaſon of good things. Cull therfore what is religious, pious, and right, out of what Church ſoeuer, and hauing gathered them, as it were into a bundle, ſettle them as a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome in the heart of the English.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Saint Auguſtine vpon the like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. <hi>But other things which are diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified in diuers places and regions: as is that, that ſome faſt ſaturday, ſome not: ſome dayly communicate the body and bloud of our Lord, others receiue certaine
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36392:64"/>dayes onely: in ſome place no day is omitted, wherein it is not offered: in others, on ſaturday and ſunday onely, in others againe, on ſunday alone: or what euer may be obſerued of this nature, the whole kind of them haue free obſeruances: nor can a graue and prudent Chriſtian obſerue any better rule or diſcipline herein, then to behaue himſelfe according to the Church where he chanceth for the time to light: for what is neither enioyned againſt faith, nor good manners, may be indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently obſerued, and may be kept for their ſocietie amongſt whom we liue.</hi>

                     <p>To this my anſwer was, that therfore ſaint Gregorie exclaimed againſt the proud and pompous title of VNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALL BISHOP vhich Iohn Patriarke of Conſtantinople aſſumed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, becauſe he apprchended that thereby all the office or dignitie of Bishop was abſorpt or exhauſted, ſo as none should be Bishop but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.

Tearming the Sea of Rome, THE HEAD OF ALL THE CHVRCHES. NOT KNOWING WHAT BISHOP IS NOT SVBIECT TO IT. WHERE PETER WAS APPOINTED BY ALMIGHTY GOD TO BE OVER ALL THE CHVRCH: THAT NO COMMVNION IS LAW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FVLL WHICH THAT CHVRCH ADMITTS NOT.

                     <p>Doth he not profeſſe openly, <hi>that the cauſe of the Patriarch of Conſtantinople</hi> (though the Emperour reſided there) <hi>was, according to the Canons, deuolued to

                     <p>If we will then heare Gregorie, lets heare him throughly: If we fly to his authoritie, let vs ſtand to his verdict.

If it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie head or chiefe-bishop of the VNIVERSALL CHVRCH, it is but ROMES DVE: if it would entayle the whole right, power, and dignitie of Bishop vpon Rome alone, Rome reiects it as ſacrilegious and blaſphemous, and ſo doe we.</p>

                     <p>For ſuch they preciſely are which Rome did alwayes challenge, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belonging to her owne iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. Heare in confirmation of this, what ſaint Gregorie writes to the Bishop of Iuſtiniana prima l. 2. ep. 46. <hi>If any cauſe of faith, or crime, or Money-matter, be commenced againſt our fellow-Bishop Adrian Bishop of Thebes, if it be a thing of little impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, let it be iudged by our Nuncio'es</hi> (Reſponſales) <hi>who are, or shall be in the Royall Cittie (Conſtantinople) but if it be a matter of weight, let it be referred hither,</hi> to the Sea Apoſtolique.

Yea the verie Fathers (to the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of 61.) of the Mileuitane Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36392:77"/>wrote to Pope Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tius in theſe tearmes. <hi>Wheras God by his ſpeciall grace hath placed thee in the Sea Apoſtolique, and hath giuen vs thee ſuch an one (tale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, one ſo qualified, or ſo good) in our dayes, that it would rather be imputed to our negligence, if we should conceale from thy veneration, what we iudge ought to be repreſented for the Churches aduantage; then that we neede to apprehend, that thou wouldſt eſteeme it importune or otherwiſe ſlight the ſame: we beſeech thee daigne to employe thy paſtorall care in the great dangers of the infirme members of Chriſt: for a new and moſt pernicious hereſie, &amp;c.</hi> Againe in the ſame place; <hi>while we intimate theſe things to thy Apoſtolicall heart, we neede not vſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny words to exaggerate ſo great an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, which we doubt not thou wilt ſo deeply reſent, that thou wilt not be able to contayne thy ſelfe from correcting them &amp;c.</hi> Againe, <hi>But we conceiue (by the mercy of our Lord God Chriſt Ieſus, who daignes both to direct thy counſells, and to heare thy prayers) that they who hold thoſe peruerſe and pernicious tenets,

And in the end of the ſame Epiſtle, We <hi>addreſſed theſe writings to your Holineſſe from the Councell of Numidia</hi> (to witt from Mileui) <hi>imitating our fellow-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Prouince of Carthage, who we perceiue haue written vpon this ſubiect to the ſea Apoſtolike, which</hi> (ſea Apoſtolike) <hi>thou a bleſſed man doſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate,</hi> (or which your holineſſe doth gouerne, <hi>quam Beatus illuſtras.</hi>)</p>
                     <p>Thus did the whole Councell de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre to the Sea Apoſtolike. Heare now how this reſpect is receiued by Pope Innocentius. <hi>With care,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and congruitie did you exhibite reſpect to the Apoſtolicall honour, (to his honour, I ſay, who beſides what was without, had the ſolicitude of all the Churches) in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king what ſentence you are to hold in points of great difficultie, following there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the forme of the ancient rule, which you know the whole world obſerues with me.</hi> Behold how Pope Innocentius aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the honour done to himſelfe,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36392:78"/>to S. Peter: as to one who had the care of all the Churches, and declares, that in hauing recourſe to him, to know what they should hold in points of GREAT DIFFICVLTIE, they doe but follow the ancient forme of proceeding, which (as he ſaith they knew) all the world obſerues. Heare againe, S. Auguſtine confirming the ſame: <hi>What anſwer could that holy man returne to the Africane Councells, but that which the Apoſtolicall Sea and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church holds of old perſeuerantly with the reſt?</hi> And what forme of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding did they (amongſt the reſt) expreſſe? Marrie that they were to betake themſelues to his <hi>Paſtorall care in the great dangers of the infirme mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Chriſt,</hi> as to condemne Hereſie, &amp;c. That they were to intimate <hi>ſuch things</hi> to his <hi>Apoſtolicall heart to haue them corrected:</hi> That <hi>the authoritie of his Holineſſe, is drawne out of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of holy Scripture.</hi> Is this to miſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge or deny the ſupremacie of Rome? No: let onely this forme of proceeding be obſerued; this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:36392:78"/>endured; this authoritie be acknowledged, and we shall thus farre moſt willingly ioyne hands, and make the verie Councells which are alleadged againſt vs, the modell of our practice. So farre falls M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. C. short in his proofes drawen from the Councell of Mileui: Will you heare how much better he ſpeeds in the 6.

                     <p>Thirdly, whatſoeuer was ſaid, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done; what euer was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, nothing was enacted or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed againſt the right of <hi>Maior per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> to witt Bishops, in their appeales to Rome, who kept their priuileges, according to that of S.

                     </p>
                     <p>Now the Africane Bishops, not finding this in the Councell of Nice, and not otherwiſe being acquainted with the Councell of Sardis, ſaue onely whith a ſpurious one, (made neere Sardis by the Arrians) as S.

Theſe papers of his came afterwards into the hands of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall Catholiques, and each one anſwered that which hee hapned on, or which was (if any was) more particularly addreſſed to him; which is the reaſon that hee hath more anſwerers than one, though to them all, any one was more than enough. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt his papers, this against the fowrth Councell of Lateran came to my hands, to which I ſoone after returned a briefe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,

                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p>It was called, <hi>Maximum,</hi> you ſay, for the number of eight hundred Priors and Abbots, (who had no voyce in Councell but by priuiledge from the Pope) was as great againe as the number of the Bishops. Tis true that it was iuſtly called <hi>maximum</hi> partly for this reaſon, though not for this only, for the number of voyces, not only of Bishops who haue their ſuffrages by common right, but euen of Abbots and Priors, who haue theirs by the Popes grant, doth main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contribute to the greatneſſe of a Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell. Yet ſuppoſe the greatneſſe of this Councell be to be meaſured by the nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of Bishops only, how many can there be named greater? but very few in the world; and therfore it may well be called, <hi>Maximum.</hi> And <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berrimum</hi>
                           <pb n="8" facs="tcp:36392:99"/>alſo; not, that ſo many met together, but did nothing, (as you ſay;) but becauſe there were preſent the Pope in perſon, two Patriarchs in perſon, and the other two by their Legats, the Greeke and Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours by their Legats, the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadours of the kings of France, Spaine, England, Hieruſalem and Cyprus, with others; as I shall proue anon. But if to be famous for doing nothing, and for being to no purpoſe deſerue the title of <hi>Celeberrimum,</hi> theſe goodly obiections, when they are well knowne, will iuſtly beare that title on their brow.</p>
                        <p>You further tell vs, that Platina (whoſe words you cite) was the Popes owne Secretary: and you doe it either to no purpoſe, or elſe to inſinuate, that therfore hee was more knowing in the truth of the ſtory, or the more faithfull hiſtorian, or both. For the former, it had indeed beene likely, if hee had beene Secretary to the Pope, vnder whom this Councell aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, as any one would thinke you
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:36392:99"/>meant, when you added this note in ſuch a weighty parentheſis. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it is, that Platina was borne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny yeares after the celebration of this Councell, and died in the yeare 1481. which was aboue 260. yeares after this Councell; as ſaith Trithemius de ſcriptorib. Eccleſ as hee is cited in the workes of Platina, the page before the Epiſtle. This therfore is but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiptfull inſinuation of yours. Or if you did not ſay this with intent to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue others, but were your ſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued; ſurely your care to informe your ſelfe well before you write, is very ſmall. Beſides if it were true, that hee had beene the Popes <hi>owne</hi> Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, as for greater <hi>emphaſis</hi> you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe it, yet his authority cannot counterpoyſe the authority of all that are of a contrary mind, (to that you thinke Platina was of,) whom I shall by and by produce. And laſtly Platina doth not affirme to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice of this Councell, that which you erroneously imagine hee doth, as I shall preſently shew. As for his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:36392:100"/>faithfullneſſe, I doe not thinke you will make his being the Popes owne Secretary an argument therof; men of your coate are not ſuch honourers of the Pope.</p>
                        <p>Now for the words themſelues of Platina, you misvnderſtand them; for you apply thoſe words, <hi>nec decerni ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men quicquam aperte potuit,</hi> generally, to the whole buſineſſe of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, whereas the intent of them, at the moſt, is but particular concerning the Holy Land, as the fore-going words doe shew, which are theſe: <hi>At Pontifex vbi videret Saracenorum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiam in Aſia concreſcere, apud Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranum, maximum Concilium celebrat. Venere multa tum quidem in conſultatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem, nec decerni tamen quicquam apertè potuit, quod &amp; Piſani &amp; Genuenſes ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritimo, &amp; Ciſalpini terreſtri bello interſe certabant.</hi> Theſe words then, <hi>nec decer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni tamen quicquam apertè potuit,</hi> are at the moſt to bee referred to the bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe of the Holy Land, of ſending ayde thither, and making reſiſtance againſt the Turkes in Aſia, and to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:36392:100"/>nothing elſe. And the reaſon why nothing could bee decreed in that matter, was the warres hee mentions, which could not bee a hindrance from their making of other Canons in that Councell.</p>
                        <p>And as it is apparent enough, that this at moſt, was the meàning of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, to wit, that nothing was decreed concerning the Holy warre; and that therfore this place makes nothing to your purpoſe, who hereby would make voyde all the Canons of this Councell; ſoe it is alſo apparent that Platina (if ſoe much was his meaning) was deceiued euen in that; and that there was ſomething decreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſending of aſſiſtance to the Holy Land, as appeareth by the decree of the Expedition, which is at the end of the Canons, whoſe truth I shall further proue by and by. Yea, and that Platina did not ſoe much as deny the decree of the Expedition, in his words, <hi>nec decerni quicquam apertè potuit,</hi> is very probable; for then hee would rather haue ſaid, <hi>nec decerni
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:36392:101"/>quicquam potuit,</hi> abſolutely; but his qualiſication of it by the word <hi>apertè,</hi> ſeemes to grant that ſomething was done, though not <hi>apertè.</hi> And that ſomething was decreed, is manifeſt by that which I shall ſay hereafter; what then hee meanes by theſe words, <hi>nec apertè,</hi> in that which was decreed, is not manifeſt. Perhaps by Decree, hee meanes the execution of the Decree, in actuall warring againſt the Turkes, wherein there was nothing openly done, whatſoeuer might bee ſecretly done rending to their preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. If this bee his meaning, (as no other can bee with truth in the thing) then, though his words bee obſcure, and improper to ſignifie thus much, yet his meaning is true, but nothing to your purpoſe.</p>
                        <p>But Nauclerus doth open this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, and makes it cleere againſt you; for hee ſpeaking of the ſame bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and vſing the ſame words with Platina, in the reſt, inſteed of Platina's <hi>apertè,</hi> hee ſaith <hi>aptè;</hi>

                        <p>As for Matthew Paris his <hi>Hiſtoria minor,</hi> I cannot meet with it, and in the volume of his whole workes both <hi>maior</hi> and <hi>minor,</hi> ſet forth lately by Dr Wats of London: I can finde no ſuch words as you cite. And if you had beene willing that your quotation should haue beene examined, you would haue giuen a man a neerer ayme than a whole hiſtory, whether <hi>maior</hi> or <hi>minor,</hi> to finde it in, eſpecially in a quotation ſo important to your mayne deſigne; vnleſſe you meant to giue a man more trouble than is faire in one that writes a controuerſie.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:36392:102"/>negotio cernerent,</hi> which are all that concerne your purpoſe, bee to bee found in him, hee ſpeakes of the ſame expedition of the Holy Land, and of the execution therof, not of the Decree it ſelfe, as the word <hi>geri</hi> will aſwell beare in its ſignification: and if hee mea<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t otherwiſe hee had no good intelligence in the buiſineſſe, (as I shall preſently proue;) for though hee liued in the ſame time of this Councell, yet hee liued in a farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t place.

                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p>You further ſay, that there are many things beſides, which may make you iuſtly ſuſpect the authority of this <hi>pretended</hi> great Councell, as you are pleaſed to call it. I eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue that there are many things that make you not only to ſuſpect, but flatly to reiect the authority of this and many other Generall Councells, but none iuſtly. But it is not the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of this Generall Councell, (which is the ſame in all,) but the verity of the Canons and Decrees therof (you would haue ſayd) and the authority of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that affirme thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, that you with ſo much ſagacity ſuſpect. And if you thinke the Councell and the Canons thereof but pretended, which are acknowledged true by the voyce of all the Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques of the world, what shall make them to be accounted reall? or shall the voyce, of one pretended Deane di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish their reality? And if you thinke this Councell but pretendedly Great, which conſiſted of the great eſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36392:106"/>of the greateſt perſons both Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall and ſecular, that euer met together in the world, I muſt needs thinke that the common ſence and vnderſtanding of a man, is in you but pretended. Doth not Platina <hi>the Popes owne Secretary,</hi> cloſe by the words cited by you, ſay, <hi>Pontifex apud Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranum, maximum Concilium celebrat?</hi> And doth not your owne Mathew Paris, in the words by you cited, ſay <hi>Concilium illud Generale?</hi> beſides many more and better witneſſes. And can you after all this, call it ſoe ſcornefully a pretended Great Councell? yea no Generall Councell, no Councell at all? as you doe in the latter end of your pamphlet. Surely you are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liath that defie the whole hoſte of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raël, yet euery one, though as little as Dauid, is able to cut of your head, with your owne ſword.</p>
                        <p>Now the grounds of your ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherby you would diſmount the Canons of this great Councell, are ſo feeble, that they shew you are no skilfull enginier. Wherof one is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:36392:106"/>Merlin hath it not in his edition, hee could not meet with it, to ſet it forth. But this is a poore argument; for firſt wee know that there were many other Councells which Merlin could not meet with, which haue ſince beene put forth, and Proteſtants I thinke will not deny, that there were ſuch, as the ſecond of Nice, fower of Lateran, two of Lions, one of Vienne, and one of Florence; and this of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence was celebrated later than any that hee ſets downe, and was the laſt Generall one, that was held before his publishing of his booke, about fower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore yeares before it. And yet it ſeemes that hee could not meet with the Records of this Councell, or elſe hee did purpoſely omit it, which is not likely, how much more eaſy then was it for him to miſſe this of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, which was held about 300. yeares before. Beſides, it is manifeſt that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the world at that time, nor hee himſelfe did belieue, that hee had ſet forth all the Councells; as appeares by the king of France his Priuiledge at the beginning of his worke, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:36392:107"/>his owne words at the end of his Epiſtle before the ſecond volume. The words of the kings Priuiledge are theſe, <hi>Coneilia quae in Eccleſia à tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus Apoſtolorum vſque ad conceſſum Baſilienſem celebrata potuerunt coacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uart,</hi> by which it appeares that as they were all that they could then get, ſo they were not abſolutely and certainly all that were. The words of Merlin himſelfe are theſe. <hi>Nam ſi authentica, integra, ſolida, &amp; à me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dis expertia fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaria, vndehaec fideliter excerp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta ſunt, apprime caſtigata ſunt, pura, vera, &amp; ſincera quae profero, ſuoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Archetyporu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> quidem germanam conditionem prae ſe fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentia, quae ſi grato animo tuleris, prope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diem (conſide) ampliora noſtris te ſudori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus aſſecuturum:</hi> by which it likewiſe appeares that hee did belieue that there were diuers others which hee had not ſet downe. Now for you to inferre that becauſe hee could not meet with this Councell of Lateran, therefore there was none ſuch, is a very vniuſt conſequence, and is as ſtrong againſt the eight other aboue named, as againſt this.</p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="tcp:36392:107"/>
                        <p>Another ground of your shrewd ſuſpition is, becauſe Cochlaeus firſt put it forth, and becauſe hee put it forth but lately; ſoe that you obiect both againſt the perſon, and againſt the time. For the perſon of Cochlaeus, you ſay, hee was not a man ſo well to bee truſted; and to make that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, you ſay, that hee feigned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things in writing Luthers life. Againſt the time of Cochlaeus his edition you obiect, becauſe it was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet forth, to wit, in the yeare 1538. three yeares after Merlin ſet forth his edition of the Councells. I will firſt conſider the truth of what you ſay, and then the force therof. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Cochlaeus his edition of this or any other Councell, I can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that Bellarmine in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies reckons him amongſt ſuch as haue writ of the Councells, yet hee doth not reckon it amongſt the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of his workes, in his booke de Script. Eccleſ. nor can I find it heere in Paris. Yet taking what you ſay in this for granted, I doe not find that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:36392:108"/>hee was a man leſſe to be truſted than Merlin, or any other; for Bell: calleth him, <hi>Vir doctiſsimus, &amp; fidei Catholicae propugnator eximius;</hi> and therfore you who traduce a man without any proofe, are much leſſe to be truſted than he yea than any man I know, for your many falſifications, proued both in this and your other writings. As for your ſaying that <hi>hee faigned many things in writing Luthers life,</hi> that is but a new ſlander which as you doe not offer to proue, ſo it is impoſſible you should; for how can you know the heart of another ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from whence his faigning muſt proceed Hee may indeed write that which is falſe, but that hee did ſo by his owne fiction, and not by others misinformation, you cannot be aſſured, vnleſſe hee himſelfe had confeſſed it, which you doe not proue that hee hath Nor doe you proue ſo much as that hee hath written any thing falſe of Luther.</p>
                        <p>You alſo ſuſpect Cochlaeus his edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Councells in regard of the time, becauſe hee ſet it forth lately.
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:36392:108"/>And what I pray, is lately? you ſay, the yeare 1538. which is a hundred and eight yeares agoe. Indeed in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of the Apoſtles times it is but lately, but in compariſon of the inuention of printing, which was but about two hundred yeares agoe, and according to the ordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſchollers in editions of bookes, I belieue none will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count a booke ſet forth a hundred and eight yeares agoe, a thing lately ſet forth. Much leſſe haue you reaſon to accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it ſo, ſeing you doe not account Merlins ſo, which yet (as you ſay) was ſet out but three yeares before. It is a paradox to ſay, Merlin an antient writer in the yeare 1535. Cochlaeus a late writer in the yeare 1538. Can three yeares odds in a hundred and eleuen make one to be called late, and therfore to be (as you ſay) ſuſpected, and not the other? Surely if this your argument of lateneſſe be good againſt one, it is ſo againſt both; wherby you may, according to your prudence, ſuſpect all the Councells ſet forth by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:36392:109"/>Merlin. But I will giue your ſuſpition yet more ſcope; for Merlin published the Councells in the yeare 1524. as appeares by the laſt words of the whole worke; ſo that Cochlaeus his edition was full fourteene yeares after Merlins, according to your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of Cochlaeus. And now to turne the poynt of your argument vpon your ſelfe, this laterneſſe of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlaeus is ſo farre fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being a ground of ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that it is (by iuſt ſo much) a ſtronger confirmation of the truth and exactneſſe of his worke. It was but by accident that the Councells were printed at any time; they might haue beene let alone till this preſent yeare, or not printed at all, would that haue made you ſuſpect the truth of them all? it would then haue made the world ſuſpect you for à very weake man, or rather haue put you below all ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But it ſo falling out that the Councells were printed at ſenerall times, by the care of ſeuerall men, the later they were printed, the more mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes had the publisher to make further
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:36392:109"/>ſearch, and to enforme himſelfe out of the Manuſcripts more fully; as wee find, that in all editions of bookes, the lateſt (if the publisher apply due dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence) are moſt full, moſt pure, and moſt correct. I hope you will not ſay that the late edition of S. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Henry Sauill, is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more ſuſpitious. So that heere is neither truth in the grounds of your ſuſpition, nor reaſon that this laſt should be any ground, though it were true.</p>
                        <p>You ſay moreouer, that Cochlaeus ſayes, that hee had the Decrees of this Councell out of an antient booke, but where hee got that booke, or who firſt compiled it, or of what authority it was, hee tells vs nothing at all. And you adde your coniecture, as weake as your former ſuſpition, that it is moſt likely, that that booke was the Popes Decretalls, where the ſuppoſed Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of This Councell are ſcattered in ſeuerall places. Concerning Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus I can ſay nothing, ſeeing I cannot meet (as I ſaid before) with this his
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36392:110"/>worke that you cite, but I will fauour you ſo farre as to ſuppoſe you ſay true, &amp; the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider the purpoſe of it, which indeed is none at all. But for that hee had it out of an ancient booke is much to his purpoſe, which booke (I will be bold to coniecture, ſeeing you are ſo for your liking) was the very Originall of the Councell it ſelfe; and where hee got it, is impertinent for you to demand. And for this my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture I will giue you good ground, this, that in Crabs edition of the Councells I finde an Epiſtle to the Reader before the beginning of this Councell, the title wherof is this; <hi>Bartholomens Laurens Nouimagenſis, Lectorl;</hi> the beginning of the Epiſtle this. <hi>Haec ſunt quae ex Archetypo illo cuius ſupra mentio ſit, lectu adeo difficili, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo labore deſcripſimus; quae ſicui grata &amp; vtilia fuerint, primum gratias agat Deo, qui horum qualecunque exemplar hucuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que ſeruauit; deinde F. Petro Crab, qui hoc ipſum vt inter Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cilia ederetur, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauit</hi> And this perhaps is the preface which you mention hereafter and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:36392:110"/>to Cochlaeus, for other I finde not. But whoſe ſoeuer it was, it proues thus much, that this Councell (which was firſt published (that I can find) by Peter Crab) was taken out of the Original Record, than which there can be no better authority; and ſo hee ſaith againe in the body of his Epiſtle, <hi>certè in editione hac ſcdulo curatum eſt, ne quicquam ei ab Archetypo alienum ingeri poſſei.</hi> And in this edition is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the expeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and the others, which in particular you hereafter ſeeke to nullifie, wherby thoſe obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are before hand anſwered; yet I will ſay more when I come to them. But ſuppoſe the Decrees of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell had beene taken out of the Popes Decretalls (the originall being loſt, as were the Canons of the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Nice, which makes ſo much vncertainty about the number of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) into which they were inſerted (as I shewed before) by Gregory the ninth, but a few year es after they were made; in ſeuerall places, according to the ſeuerall titles to which they were
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36392:111"/>to be referred (which you diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully call ſcattering) what impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this vnto their credit? The Popes Decretalls are a teſtimony of no ſmall reputation amongſt all learned Chriſtians. And why I pray ſcatterings? the Decretalls are not a collection of the Councells, that ſo you should expect euery Canon in his order, but à digeſtion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons of all the Councells that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne to one matter vnder one head; like the collection of the Statutes of England by Raſtall and others; (out of which if one would vndertake to extract all the lawes made in Queene Elizabeths raigne, hee muſt looke perhaps in a hundred ſeuerall places) which yet I thinke you will not call ſcattering, but methodicall digeſtion. But theſe are the reproaches throwne vpon the chiefe ſpirituall father of the Chriſtian world, by thoſe whom God hath (like Symeon and Leui) for the cruell ſchiſme they haue made in the Church, <hi>diuided in Iaacob and ſcattered in Iſrael.</hi> But from whence
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36392:111"/>ſoeuer the firſt publisher of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell tooke the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s thereof, certaine it is that they were acknowledged, and aſcribed to this Councell, by a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony aboue all exception, namely, of the whole clergy of England in a Councell at Oxford, as I haue shewed before, &amp; that, 12. yeares before the booke of the Decretalls was compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. So that from the Decretalls is not the firſt view that wee haue of the Canons of this Councell.</p>
                        <p>You againe repeat, and ſay, Thoſe <hi>ſcatterings</hi> (you belieue) Cochlaeus or ſome other did collect together, and made vp one body of them in manner and forme of a Councell. But ſo ill fauoured a forme hee hath giuen it, that it often betrayeth it ſelfe not to be genuine, and taken out of any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentique coppie. Euen now you ſayd (without doubt) that it was Cochlaeus that ſet forth this Councell, now, it was hee or ſome other; and this I muſt needs grant is very true; for if it be ſet forth, certainly it was either by one or another. And if it were not Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36392:112"/>then haue you loſt much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in ſeeking to poyſon his credit herein. And if it were ſome other, then is your decrying this Councell by reaſon of this edition of Cochlaeus, of no force, for then I affirme, that this <hi>ſome other,</hi> was a man of the greateſt credit of all other, and ſo the caſe is cleere againſt you, out of your owne words, and you ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing heere to impeach the credit of this other; which I wonder at, for you may aſwell ſpeake againſt you know not whom, as ſay you know not what, as you doe in all this diſcourſe. You tooke it ill of Cochlaeus that hee did not tell you where hee had that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient booke; and haue not wee much more reaſon to take it ill of you, that will not tell vs who it was that firſt put forth this Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell you ſo much finde fault with, nor giue vs any ayme to finde out this editio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you meane (writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by you know not whom) from any other? but although you heere fayle vs, yet you thinke you come home to vs in that which followes;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36392:112"/>and although you know not who firſt put forth this Councell, and that wee know that both firſt and laſt haue done it in the ſame manner; yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out relation to the publisher, the very forme of this Councell, you ſay is ſo ill fauouted, that it often be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth it ſelfe not to be genuine, and taken out of any authentique coppy. Which deepe charge of yours againſt this Councell will recoyle vpon your ſelfe, and by the ill fauoured forme therof, betray it ſelfe not to be ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerly, nor taken out of any authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que coppy, either of reaſon or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

                        <p>Will any man thinke theſe be the words of a man that conſiders what hee ſayes? who will belieue, who can perſuade himſelfe, that a pillar of his ſect, should frame an accuſation againſt a Councell, which (to phraſe it moſt gently,) is (I belieue) the greateſt ouerſight that euer was yet committed in this kinde. You ſay that
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36392:113"/>this Councell while it was ſitting, doeth cite it ſelfe, as a Councell that had ſitten ſome while before; and to proue it you alleadge ſix places, wherein there is mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Lateran; and you moſt weakly imagine, that the Councell of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran there ſpoken of, is this Councell of Lateran that ſpeaketh. Know then (and a great shame it is that you should be guilty of ſuch an ignorance, as not to know it before you framed this terrible obiection) that there were foure Councells of Lateran, (according to the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued opinion concerning the place) of which three were before this; and the Councell of Lateran cited in this, was that which was celebrated next before this, vnder Pope Alexander the third, in the yeare 1180, wherein all thoſe places you (more punctually than any other) doe alleadge, are to be found. And is it poſſible that you (who talke ſometimes, as if you had beene Secretary to all the Councells) could be ſo ignorant, as neuer to haue
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36392:114"/>read or heard of any Councell of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but this, ſo that finding in this the Councell of Lateran cited, you should thinke this Councell cited it ſelfe? for if you had but read this Councell in Binius, you should haue found all theſe places by you cited, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to their particular chapters, in the former Councell of Lateran, vnder Alexander the third. Or if any man had forged this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell (as you iniuriouſly to vs imagine) could you thinke him ſo ſilly a fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as to conceiue ſuch a groſſe ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity as this, should ſteale away vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerued? And if hee did not belieue hee should alwayes eſcape vndiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, (as to his eternall vnhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, by your ſeuerer inquiſition, hee hath not,) could you thinke him ſo foolish asto doe a thing in it ſelfe moſt abſurd and impertinent, which had no end in it, (for it was all one whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this Councell cited the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Lateran or no,) and which could arriue at no other end, but the ruine of that which was his maine
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:36392:114"/>deſigne, namely, the begetting of the worlds beliefe to this his edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Councell; to which he muſt needs foreſee, that this would be the vndoubted ouerthrow?</p>
                        <p>But howeuer, you make bold to ſlight and traduce ſome particular Catholiques, though moſt learned and vertuous, yet (to vſe a frequent word of your owne, but much more ſeaſonably) <hi>I wonder how you dare,</hi> ſo eaſily to condemne all Catholiques in generall; as to ſuppoſe that all the Popes, Catholique Bishops, Diuines, Canoniſts, and other learned men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable of the Catholique Church, yea thoſe whoſe intereſt is mightily concerned in this Councell, euen all temporall Princes, whoſe Lay-depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants are not few in number, nor faint in courage, nor all defectiue in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but ſome of them very eminent therein, were all ſo blind to this grand abſurdity as not to ſee it, if they were Clergy, not one amongſt ſo many millions not to haue ſo much feare of the God of heauen nor honeſty
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36392:115"/>as to diſcouer it; if they were of the Laity, not to haue ſo much regard to the God of this world, proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and to humane prudence, as to publish this prodigious forgery; but to ſuffer theſe Canons to be blanched ouer with the title of a great Generall Councell, and by that meanes cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant through the world, vntill you with much induſtry and art, come and diſcouer this long hidden ſecret, and myſtery of iniquity, to Catholiques eternall shame (as you ſurely thinke) and your owne eternall honour.</p>
                        <p>But now you may ſee, that when men with pride and obſtinacy fight againſt the truth, they fall into that pit of shame and folly, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd for others. Yea you goe on with more courage than foreſight, thus;</p>

                     <p>Therfore thirdly, Cochlaeus is faine to excuſe the matter by a coniecture, (in his preface to this Councell ſet forth by Crab) that theſe decrees were collected and brought into this forme, wherein hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents them, by Pope Innocentius himſelfe,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:36392:115"/>ſome while after the Councell was done. He cites three chap. of the Councell to that purpoſe, (three of thoſe ſix that are named afore) and ſayes, the Reader will eaſily deprehend aſmuch. But what reader will like it well, that the decrees of a Councell should be written ſome while after the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell is ended? It was alwayes the vſe of Councells to write their owne decrees, and to ſigne them too, before they went away. And Innocent the Pope was not ſo weake a Scribe, as to make the Synode it ſelfe ſpeake after ſuch a manner, <hi>In Laterane<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſi Concilio noſcitur fuiſſe prohibitum; or, fiat hoc, ſecundum quod prouiſum eſt in Lateranenſi Concilio &amp;c.</hi> which certainly is not the ſtile of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell concerning it ſelfe; Innocent the third knew well enough what belonged to it.</p>
                     <div type="answer">
                        <head>ANSWER.</head>
                        <p>Firſt you made Cochlaeus guilty of a fowle fault, and now you bring him in making an excuſe, and both falſely. Firſt, I can finde no ſuch coniecture as you ſpeake of, and ſecondly if it were to be found, it is no excuſe. You ſay
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36392:116"/>it is to be found in his preface to this Councell ſet forth by Crab; but wee may ſooner gather the Sibylls leaues than finde it, for there is no ſuch thing. There is indeed an epiſtle of Bartholomaeus Laurens, which I haue mentioned before, &amp; by which you were confuted, it being thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued that that edition was taken out of the originall, for which there needs no excuſe. Beſides, it is a thing in it ſelfe improbable, that Cochlaeus who (as you ſay) wrote this Councell himſelfe, should afterwards write a preface to another mans edition of the ſame Councell. But ſuppoſe this coniecture you mention (to wit, <hi>that theſe decrees were collected and brought into this forme he preſents them, by Pope Innocent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſome while after the Councell was done</hi>) be ſome where to be found; what excuſe is this I pray, or what doth it excuſe? If the coniecture be true, it confimes the whole cauſe againſt you: namely, that all theſe decrees were made in the Councell; if it be falſe, it is nothing. But you draw co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequences
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:36392:116"/>from hence which are certainly moſt pittifull and inconſequent, with which while you thinke to ſtrengthen your cauſe, you doe weaken the credit of your owne vnderſtanding.</p>
                        <p>You ſay, what reader will like it well; that the decrees of a Councell should be written ſome while after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell is ended? And I ſay, what reader (but your captious ſelfe) will diſlike it? Indeed if the decrees of the Councell had beene written ſome while before the Councell began, you might iuſtly haue asked, who would haue liked it; but to aske who will like, that they should be written afterwards, is moſt ridiculous. But you ſuppoſe, becauſe it is ſayd in the coniecture you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, that they were collected and digeſted into the forme they are in, after the Councell was done, that therfore they were not written in any forme, no not at all in the Councell it ſelfe; to which purpoſe you ſay, that it was alwayes the vſe of Councells to write their owne decrees, <hi>and to ſigne them too,</hi> (as very pertinently you
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:36392:117"/>adde) before they went away; intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hereby, that they did not ſo in this Councell; and your reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Pope Innocent did collect them into the forme they now are in, ſome while after the Councell was done. Surely you did not conſider what all impartiall men would conceiue of your ability, ſeeing you make ſuch an inference as this; ſo poore, that few in the world would haue made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues guilty of the like. And I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of all theworld, whether the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of the Councell could not be written, <hi>and ſigned too,</hi> by, and in the Councell, and yet be brought into this forme, or method, wherein they now are, by Pope Innocent ſome while after? euery one that hath but common ſenſe will conclude againſt you. Yea his collecting and putting them into a forme ſome while after, is à proofe (cleane contrary to what you inferre, namely) that they were written ſome where, and in ſome forme or other before. For otherwiſe from whence should Pope Innocent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:36392:117"/>collect theſe decrees? out of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory? that is moſt improbable. Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection imports not the inuenting or making them, but the gathering of them out of ſome Records or other; and out of the originall it is moſt likely (if he gathered them at all) that he tooke his collection, ſeeing he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in the time and place of this Councell, and was preſent and preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent therein. Your argument then is no better than this, The Scriptures of the Prophets and Apoſtles were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and brought into a forme writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and printed, againe and againe, after the firſt writers were dead and gone; therfore they were not at firſt written by themſelues or their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignes.</p>
                        <p>You further labour to aſſoyle Pope Innocent from the guilt of forging theſe Decrees, (for you take it for graunted that they were forged, and Cochlaeus you are moſt conſtant to, for the man that forged them,) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Pope Innocent was not ſo weake aſcribe (you ſay) to make the Synode
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36392:118"/>quote it ſelfe; Wherein you might well haue ſpared your paynes, for <hi>Quis (quaeſo) vnquam vituperauit Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?</hi> who, I pray, euer accuſed Pope Innocent hereof? you thinke Coch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laeus doth, becauſe he coniectures (as you ſay) that theſe Decrees were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and brought into this forme by Pope Innocent, after the Councell was diſſolued; as if to collect decrees, and bring them into ſome or other forme after the diſſolution of the Councell, were all one as to forge them? A conceipt ſurely vnworthy of any iudicious man. Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t the Pope (you ſay, and truly,) was not ſo weake a Scribe as to make the Synod quote it ſelfe, he knew well enough what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to it. Yet ſo vnhappy are you, that you cannot ſupport this truth, (which no body puts you to, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying) but by affirming a greater falshood, namely, that this Councell doth cite it ſelfe. But if you had beene ſo good a Scribe, as to haue knowne aſwell what belongeth to the making of obiections againſt a Councell, as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36392:118"/>Pope Innocent did the ſtile of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, you would I thinke haue kept your owne counſell, and beene more ſilent in this matter. But you goe on, and ſay.</p>

                        <p>You ſay, wee had beſt therfore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieue Platina; which I graunt wee may doe, but not your ſenſe of his words, which I haue already refuted. But
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36392:119"/>what degree of truſt ſoeuer wee yeeld vnto Platina himſelfe, I am ſure wee had beſt giue none vnto you, in your citation of Platina, who haue wronged both him and vs, in all that you haue heere alleadged. All that he ſayes, is what you brought, and is anſwered in the beginning, <hi>nec decerni tamen quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> apertè potuit;</hi> inſteed whereof you make him ſay, <hi>non eſt decretum ibi quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> potuit ibi decerni quicqua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in beſides the explicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge of the words, you leaue out the mayne word <hi>apertè,</hi> which changeth the whole ſenſe. Platina ſaith, <hi>nothing could be decreed openly,</hi> you alleadge him ſaying, <hi>there was not, nor could be any thing at all decreed,</hi> whereas the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creeing of nothing openly, doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that ſomething was decreed, though not openly; and for the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Platina's words, I referre the reader to the firſt paragraph, where I shew, that theſe words of Platina were ſpoken with relation to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Holy warres, and not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the decrees of this Councell.</p>
                        <pb n="53" facs="tcp:36392:119"/>
                        <p>And as heere you leaue out a word to the corrupting of the ſenſe, ſo in the following words which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge, (as if they were placed in Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina as they are in you, and were a further proofe of the ſame aſſertion, whereas they haue no connexion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſenſe, and are aboue a dozen lines aſunder,) you put in a word, which is the very hindge on which the ſenſe is turned, and turned contrary to the aſſured truth thereof; and that is the word, <hi>Ipſe, he himſelfe,</hi> as if the condemnation of Almericus and the booke of Ioachim had beene the Popes act without the Councell, that ſo you might proue the Councell fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified, wherein the ſayd acts are recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to haue paſſed. And then you adde as another ſaying of Platina, or as your conſtruction of the former words of Platina, <hi>He ſayes, it was not the Councell of Lateran that made any decrees to condemne them, but that Pope Innocent condemned them himſelfe.</hi> But Platina hath neither any ſuch formall words, nor are they the meaning of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36392:120"/>the words he hath; for his ſaying the Pope did condemne them, doth not neceſſarily imply that the Councell of Lateran did not condemne them, for it might be done by both, either ſeuerally or together, and this latter way it was done, as I haue already proued, and doe now againe by the teſtimony of Beluacenſis,<note place="margin">a Beluac l <hi>30</hi> hiſt. cap. <hi>64.</hi>
                           </note> who ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this Councell ſaith, that the Abbot Ioachim and Almericus were condemned therein. So that you are <hi>Ipſe, He himſelfe,</hi> that haue falſified Platina, layd vniuſt obiections againſt the Councell of Lateran, and <hi>(apertè) manifeſtly</hi> condemned your ſelfe of fowle play by the euidence of the fact,</p>
                        <p>For a cloſe to this ſection you ſay, wee may well conclude, that both theſe and other things <hi>de quibus nihil decerni potuit in Concilio,</hi> were by the Pope ſet downe in his owne Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls; out of which he tooke theſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, whoeuer he was that compiled them into the forme of a Councell. Your concluſion is like your premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36392:120"/>there is no truth in either of them both; you ſay, that both theſe and other things, (I ſuppoſe you meane all the Canons aſcribed to this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,) were ſet downe by the Pope in his owne Decretalls, that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to your meaning, inuented by the Pope, and put firſt into his Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls; for if they were firſt decreed in Councell, and afterwards put into the Decretalls, it is not for your purpoſe, but againſt you; and that it was ſo, I haue already ſufficiently proued; and doe yet againe by the title of theſe conſtitutions, as they are ſet downe in the Decretalls; which are not barely aſcribed to the Pope, as many others are; but to him in a generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; thus, <hi>Innocentius tertius in Concilio generali.</hi> Wee may therefore well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; that your concluſion built on your extreme corruption of Platina, hauing ſo rotten a foundation muſt needs fall to the ground.</p>
                        <p>Laſtly you ſay, that he tooke them out of the Popes owne Decretalls, whoeuer he was that compiled the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36392:121"/>Canons into the forme of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell. But I haue proued before, that he tooke them out of the originall Records of the Councell; and if he had taken them out the Popes De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretalls, it had bene well enough; thoſe Decretalls not being the Popes <hi>owne,</hi> ſingly, as you haue ſayd, but the Popes and Councells of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran together, as I haue many wayes proued. So that of all that you haue hitherto ſayd, there is not one word but is either vntrue, or impertinent; and to vſe your owne words, <hi>de qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus nihil decerni poteſt.</hi> Yet as if you had not ſayd enough of this nature, you goe on to make faults, in ſteed of finding them (as you ſuppoſe) in others.</p>

                     <p>For the third Canon of this Councell (concerning the excommunication of temporall Princes, and the Popes power to free their ſubiects from all obedience to them, and to giue away their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes) is indeed one of the Extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants;, cap. <hi>13.</hi> de Haereticis, that is, Pope Innocents owne Decree, and not the Councells of Lateran, <hi>vbi nihil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerni

                        <p>The third Canon of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36392:122"/>concerning the excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of temporall Princes, you ſay, is one of the Extrauagants, <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>de Haereticis,</hi> but you are very Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uagant in ſaying ſo; for there is no ſuch matter in the place by you cited, nor indeed any ſuch place as you haue here rashly ſet downe. All that is to be found is this; that in the fifth booke of the Extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants, there is a Title <hi>de Haereticis,</hi> vnder which title are only three chapters, and in them not a word of this matter. And this for the truth of your quotation; I will now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſenſe of what you ſay, and the truth thereof. The third Canon (ſay you) is one of the Extraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants, that is, Pope Innocents owne Decree. By which it ſeemes, that it is the ſame thing with you, to be one of the Extrauagants, and to be Pope Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts owne Decree; as if the Extrauaga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts were Pope Innoce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts owne decrees; whereas it is appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t by the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to whom they are aſcribed, that not one of them was made by Pope In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; ſo mightily are you miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36392:122"/>in this matter. This Decree then is not Pope Innocents owne, and not the Councells of Lateran, as you ſay, but Pope Innocents owne, and the Councells of Lateran; his, in and with the Councell of Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, as I haue proued. You alſo cite your ſelfe (for it is to be found in no authour elſe) againſt the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Lateran, ſaying, <hi>vbi nihil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerni potuit, where nothing could be decreed;</hi> againſt which I oppoſe (beſides all that I haue ſayd before) a man of much better authority, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Crantzius, who ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Crantz.

                        </p>
                        <p>Moreouer the ſenſe of this Canon you doe lamely, and with change of the tearmes ſet downe; for there is no mention of kings nor king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; and then the Popes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoluing of the <hi>vaſſalls of temporall Lords</hi> (for thoſe are the words of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36392:123"/>the Canon) from their fidelity to them, and expoſing their land to be occupied by Catholiques, expreſt to be but in the caſe of neglect to purge their land of hereſy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance therein after excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by the Bishops, and after a yeeres contempt of making ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and then there is added this reſeruation alſo, <hi>Saluo iure Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini principalis, &amp;c. ſauing the right of the principall Lord, ſo that he giue no obſtacle hereunto, nor oppoſe any imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>diment.</hi> Now this power of the Pope, whatſoeuer it be, is farre from that which your confuſed words in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, which to your weaker readers (I ſuppoſe) will ſound, as if the Pope had power to abſolue the ſubiects of any kings from their fidelity, and diſpoſe of their kingdomes when, to whom, and for what cauſe ſo euer they pleas'd; which is nothing ſo. Yet if this power of the Popes were ſo vaſt as you belieue it, or would haue others to belieue it, why should it trouble you? And why should you
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:36392:123"/>be more tender of the intereſt of Princes than they themſelues, and all their courts about them, who either receiued this Canon imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly from the Councell, as I haue ſayd and proued, or elſe ſuffered it to be coſeningly thruſt vpon them, as you haue ſayd, but not proued.</p>
                        <p>And I wonder that you a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, should faſten vpon this decree of depoſing of Princes by the Pope, (to make the decrees of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell odious and incredible,) when as it is well knowne, that the Popes in ſixteene hundred yeeres, haue not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſo many, as Proteſtants in one hundred; for almoſt wherſoere the gangrene of that hereſy hath ſpread it ſelfe, they haue either actually depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and expelled their Princes, as in Swede, Denmarke, Scotland, Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, Geneua; or diuers times atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by violence to doe it, as in France often, in Bohemia, in Poland, and now it is feared in England. And if you ſay, that though theſe Puritane Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants haue both taught and done
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:36392:124"/>theſe things, yet the true Proteſtant of the Church of England, he neuer taught ſuch doctrine, he ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not thinke ſuch a thought without horror; ſurely wee haue nothing but your bare and often broken word for our ſecurity. For what experience hath the king, or his few predeceſſors of your religion had, that in caſe they should haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued you of your deſires, as they denyed to graunt the deſires of the Puritanes, if they should haue turned you out of your Bishoppricks and Deaneries, taken from you the Church vſurped Liuings, ſet vp a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion that would not haue endured wiuing preachers, what experience haue they had, that in theſe or the like caſes, your Proteſtants of the Church of England would not attempt their deſtruction, and if they were able, lay the axe on their necks, as your Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Gouuernour of your Church of England Queene Elizabeth and her inſtruments did, on the necke of the renowned Mary Queene of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and Dowager of France.</p>
                        <pb n="63" facs="tcp:36392:124"/>
                        <p>Can you then thinke much that the Pope, a perſon of an other quality, and more diſ-intereſſed than the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of Princes, should haue ſome kinde of power, by all conuenient wayes to reduce and correct hereticall Princes? Eſpecially ſeeing the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, Kings, and Princes gaue their votes vnto this Decree, and were, for ſo much as concerned themſelues, the makers thereof. But you will not belieue that this decree was made in the Councell, but thinke that you haue proued the contrary. My aduice then is that you acquaint the Kings and Princes on this ſide the ſeas, with this ſtrange cheat that is put vpon them; it is like to be a matter of high acceptation to them, of great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to their vnfaithfull ſeruants, that would not diſcouer that which you haue done, and of great prayſe and preferment to your ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>You further obiect againſt the Act of the expedition for the recouery of the Holy Land, (which you call the 71. Canon, but no body elſe doth ſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:36392:125"/>that I know) becauſe it runnes, ſay you, in a Popes ſtile not in the ſtile of à Councell By which I perceiue, that though you are one of the Court yet you are none of the Councell, for you are not skild in the ſtiles of Popes and Councells.</p>
                        <p>Otherwiſe you would haue knowne, that it is the manner in thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells where the Pope himſelfe is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to decree things in his name, with this addition, <hi>ſacro approbante Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilio,</hi> as in the Councell of Florence <hi>inlueris vnionis,</hi> euen as Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of England, are made in the kings name, <hi>with the aduice or conſent of the two houſes.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>You ſay moreouer, that Card. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la mine and Eudaemon Cidonius doe confeſſe out of Platina, that there was no ſuch decree made. Your Eudae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cidonius I cannot meet with heere, nor is it much materiall, for that answer which ſerues your quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bell: will ſerue him alſo, ſeeing (as you ſay) it is both their confeſſions out of Platina. For the finding of your citatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s out of Bell: you vſe vs very ill,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36392:125"/>giuing vs no direction, but a booke of perhaps twenty leaues in folio to finde out twe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ty words, which whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wee haue found, to reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pence our paynes, we finde your miſtake and falshood. For Bellarm. doth not ſpeake directly of the particular chapter of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, whether that were made in the Councell or no, but of the buiſineſſe of the Holy Warre in generall, <hi>de hoc articulo, cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> multa diſputata fuiſſent, nihil certi definiri potuit;</hi> and there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence ſure betwixt <hi>nihil certi,</hi> and <hi>nihil omnino,</hi> nothing certaine, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, as you would haue it. And I ſuppoſe this <hi>nihil certi</hi> is meant in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the further and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular managing of the warre, from which they were hindred by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent warre in Chriſte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dome, and which is no denyall of the Decree of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, which conſiſts of a few ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall heads concerning the rayſing of contributions to this great worke from the clergy, (wherein the Pope himſelfe gaue a great example) of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments on thoſe that hindred it
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36392:126"/>and indulgence to them that aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it, with the like. All which though they were vndoubtedly decreed, yet it may be ſayd with Bell: out of Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina, that after much diſputation there was nothing certaine defined, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the neerer and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar articles for the managing of the warre, being put fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it by the preſent warre in Chriſtendo me. Yea it might be ſayd <hi>nihil certi</hi> in regard of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree it ſelfe, not of the letter and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of it, but of the wars at home, yea rather the contrary was certaine, namely, that it was not executed. And if Platina (or Bellarmine out of him) had intended to exclude this Decree of the expedition (which is all that wee affirme to be done in that kinde) why did they expreſſe it with theſe reſeruations, of <hi>apertè</hi> and <hi>certi,</hi> and not ſay directly and without limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>nihil</hi> as you doe? which had beene more plaine, and agreeable to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uity of thoſe writers. Therfore by theſe reſeruations they muſt needs intend ſome thing, which (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue)
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36392:126"/>is that which I haue expreſſed. Howſoeuer, certaine wee are, that this Decree was made in the Councell, by all that proofe whereby wee haue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the whole Councell, of which this is a part; and particularly (becauſe you heere make a particular obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> againſt it) by Matth. Paris, who inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth ſo much, by repeating<note n="a" place="margin">Matth. Paris. hiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma. p. <hi>189.</hi>
                           </note> the ſubſtance of this very Decree, in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many words as they are in the Councell, which are too long to ſet downe heere.</p>
                        <p>Your further ſay, that he that made theſe two decrees, of abſoluing ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from obedience to their Princes, and of recouering the land of Promiſe from the Saracens, may well be thought to haue made the decree of Tranſubſtantiation alſo. And you ſay truth in that, but it will not helpe you; for Pope Innocent made them all, but, <hi>ſacro approbante Concilio,</hi> that is, the whole Councell, conſiſting of the Pope and the reſt of the Prelats, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed them. Nor haue you reaſon ſo to boggle at the word Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:36392:127"/>or at this Councell for the word; ſeeing the thing knew no begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſince our Sauiour, as our Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique bookes doe ſufficiently proue; and euen the word it ſelfe was in vſe before this Councell, as appeareth by <hi>Roger Houenden in Henrico</hi> 2. where he hath theſe words.<note n="b" place="margin">Annul. p. <hi>576.</hi>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36392:129"/>againſt Photius, who made a ſchiſme betweene the Latin and Greeke Church, they of the ſchiſme reiected this eighth, and many other generall Councells, which were celebrated in the weſt; amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt which this fourth of Lateran (you ſo ſtrongly and weakly fight againſt) was one; vntill the Grecians meeting againe with the Latins in the Councell of Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, the Grecians called that the eighth generall Councell; which yet ſoone after they reiected, and ſo at this day allow but ſeuen. But if men may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue and reiect Councells at their pleaſure, then you may with the Lutherans allow but ſix; with the Eutychians which are yet in Aſia, but the firſt three; with the Neſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians which are yet in the Eaſt, but the firſt two; with the Arrians and Trinitarians which are in Hungary and Poland, none at all. And this you and yours may doe with as good reaſon, as they doe reiect and reuile this of Lateran, and aboue all, the ſacred Oecumenicall Councell of Trent.</p>

                        <p>And that you may againe fall into the fault, of which you falsely accuſe others; you are out in your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the yeeres of the hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Councell of Florence; but this I doe not mention as a matter of moment, it being brought in but on the by. But I cannot omitt a weighty paſſage that you haue a little before, where you ſay, that betweene the ſeuenth and the eighth generall Councell you trow, there cannot come another, if it were ſo great and ſo generall, as this is ſayd to be. Wherby you intimate, that the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Councell was the hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that it could not come betweene the ſeuenth and the eighth, and by conſequence, that if it had beene a little one, it might haue come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene; which is a very new and pretty fancy. A little generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell it ſeemes might haue crowded in betweene the ſeuenth and the eighth as an <hi>appendix</hi> to the former, or otherwiſe haue found place and vnion with it vnder the ſame name and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36392:130"/>number of the ſeuenth, but this being ſo great and ſo generall, could not poſſibly finde a roome betwixt them, but that it muſt make two eights, as you ſay, rather than an eighth and a ninth, which ninth (if it had beene ſo, in this caſe) might yet haue beene called the eighth in ſome other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, as I haue shewed. But I had thought that Councells in regard of number being of <hi>diſcrete quantity,</hi> did not require any place by reaſon of their greatneſſe, (as if they were in this regard, of <hi>continued quantity</hi> alſo,) more than if they had beene little: the abſtract number of eight, (I trow) can no more come in, betweene ſeuen and eight, in a ſmall ſubiect tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a great, and therfore the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of this Councell was no more hinderance to its coming in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the ſeuenth and the eighth, without cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ging the name and order of the number, than if it had beene neuer ſo little.</p>
                        <p>You tell vs alſo, that in the laſt ſeſſion of the Councell of Florence
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36392:131"/>it is expreſſely ſet downe, <hi>Finis octa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ui Concilij generalis, &amp;c.</hi> yet the words more expreſſely than you haue ſet the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> downe are, <hi>Finis generalis octauae Synodi,</hi> which though not different in ſubſtance, yet the difference of the words <hi>Concilium</hi> and <hi>Synodus</hi> if you had vnderſtood the reaſon thereof, had beene enough to preuent your obiection. For it appeares hy an epiſtle of Bartholomaeus Abramus to the Archbishop of Rauenna, ſet downe by Crab at the beginning of this Councell, and by Binius at the end, that the Latin Originall of this Councell was loſt, and that this that is now extant, was tranſlated by the ſayd Abramus out of the Greeke, for which reaſon he vſeth the word <hi>Synodus</hi> according to the Greeke, &amp; not <hi>Concilium;</hi> and it is called <hi>octaua</hi> becauſe it was ſo in the greeke which hee tranſlated; and the Greekes ſet it downe ſo, becauſe (as I ſayd before) they accounted no Councells gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, but where they themſelues were preſent and which they did receiue,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36392:131"/>of which this was indeed the eighth.

And Crab though hee haue no <hi>caueat</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon this place, yet that you may ſee he ſpake according to the letter of the greeke coppy, and not his owne minde, he calleth all the Councells betwixt the 2. of Nice, and Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, Generall Councells; all that the Church accounteth ſo; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of this Councell of Lateran he ſayth, <hi>Inſtituta generalis Concilij Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranenſis tempore Innocentij Papae tertij.</hi>

                        <p>In the end of this ſection you make this notable concluſion; <hi>So that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will make two eight generall Councells, this of Lateran could be none;</hi> which out of your diſcourſe may as iuſtly be inferred thus, ſo that vnleſſe they will make two, or nine eight generall Councells, that of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople the fourth, the fower of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teran, the two of Lions, that of Vienne, that of Piſa, that of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, or ſome one of theſe could be

                        <p>The generality of this Councell you further goe about to diſproue, becauſe the Canons thereof were not (as you ſay) generally receiued; and this you proue, becauſe they were not receiued in England; but that they were not receiued in England you doe not proue, but by three inſtances, which you doe not proue; and if you had, they had proued nothing. For it is not properly the generall receiuing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36392:133"/>that makes a Councell to be generall, but the generall calling thereof from all parts of the Chriſtian world, and ſuch was this. Otherwiſe no Councell could be ſtiled generall in the calling of it, or while it was ſitting, or when it was concluded, vntill it did appeare that all the world had receiued it, which is a condition that neuer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to any Councell, becauſe ſome or other heretiques (againſt whom all generall Councells haue beene commonly called) or perhaps all, did refuſe to receiue it. So that by this your character of a generall Councell, you haue plainly casheired all the generall Councells that euer were; for euen the firſt fower, which you ſeeme to magnifie, and grant them the title of Generall, were the Canons of them generally receiued? It is manifeſt that they were not, but were reiected by all thoſe ſorts of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiques who were the occaſion of their calling.</p>
                        <p>Moreouer, your reaſon to proue that the canons of this Councell of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36392:133"/>Lateran were not generally receiued to wit, becauſe they were not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in England; if it were true, yet it is inconſequent, and your deceipt or miſtake lyeth in the indiſtinction of the word <hi>Canons,</hi> whereof ſome be of faith, ſome of manners and diſcipline. Now that a Councell be accounted to be generally receiued, it is not required that the Canons of diſcipline and practiſe be receiued in all kingdomes, but it is ſufficient that the Canons concerning mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of faith be generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, to ſtile the reception gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and the Councell generall, for ſo much as the generality of recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can contribute to the title of its being generall. As for example, the kingdome of France doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the decrees of the Councell of Trent concerning gouernment, but of faith it doth, as doe all other Catholique Countries, for which reaſon, euen this kingdome which denies to receiue the Councell of Trent in matters of gouernment,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36392:134"/>doth notwithſtanding acknowledge it generall. By which it appeares, that you are not ſo well verſed in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councells and their reception, as to know diſtinctly the meaning of the words according to their Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique vſe. Now there is no doubt that the kingdome of England did receiue this Councell for the matters of faith, otherwiſe it would haue beene noted hereticall as now it is, and for its not receiuing the Canons of diſcipline and gouernment, you proue not but by your owne bare word, which I may moſt iuſtly deny; yet I haue other proofes againſt you.</p>
                        <p>But firſt I will take notice of your miſtake (if not vnfaithfullneſſe) in your deſcription of the 46. <hi>pretended</hi> Canon (as you call it) contrary to which, you ſay, ſubſidies haue beene payd to the king, <hi>inconſulto Pontifice;</hi> as if that Canon had ſayd, that no ſubſidies at all should be payd to the king but by the aduice of the Pope, whereas the Canon ſpeakes only of
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36392:134"/>the ſubſidies of the Clergy, as requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Popes aduice. As for the practiſe of England contrary to theſe three Canons you mention, if it be true (which I doe not belieue, becauſe I haue heard good lawyers in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſay the contrary in one, which concernes preſcription) yet it doth not proue that theſe Canons were not receiued; for theſe croſſings of the Canons may happen, either through indulgence of the Pope granted to the kings, or the kings vſurpation contrary to the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s receiued; or in your inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of preſcription, through the headſtrong impiety of the people, who will not obſerue the good lawes they receiue, being contrary to their euill cuſtomes. If England had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued all the Cano<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s they haue heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore receiued, when they were as wiſe, as learned, as pious, as iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious (at the leaſt) as now they are, you and I (I belieue) should not haue beene at this bay, that now we are. Now contrary to your proofeleſſe aſſertion, I proue that the Canons of
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36392:135"/>this Councell were receiued in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as well thoſe of manners as of faith; firſt by the teſtimony of Linwood, and the municipall lawes of the land, as they are affirmed by <hi>Franciſcus à ſancta Clara,</hi> in his article of tranſubſtantiation.</p>

And yet I wonder that you that haue had the fortune to be
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36392:137"/>the pretended Deane of S. Peters Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and the pretended Maſter of S. Peters houſe, should yet be ſuch an enemy to S. Peters chayre. But if you deſire to know what makes a Councell generall, and what are the inſufficiencies thereof, which you ought to haue expreſſed and proued, before you had shot your haſty bolt of condemnation againſt this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, reade Turrecremata, and Canus vpon this ſubiect.</p>
                        <p>You at laſt conclude thus, How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer <hi>nihil ibi actum quod quidem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtet,</hi> and ſo was it neither any generall Councell, nor ſo much as any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell at all Wherein firſt your propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is falſe and hath no authority (that I know of) but the worſt in the world, your owne. Yet you ſet it downe in Latin, as if they were the words of ſome author, but neither ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the place, nor ſo much as his name, and therfore I take it for yours, and reiect it. Secondly if it were true that nothing as done there, yet your inference from thence is inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequent,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36392:138"/>to wit, that therfore it was neither any generall Councell, nor ſo much as any Councell at all; concerning the nullities of a Councell, or of the generality therof, I need ſay no more than I haue done, ſeeing it reſts on you to proue, that doing nothing is one. And for your affirmation that nothing was done, I haue fully diſpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued it through this whole diſcourſe. I will therfore only adde the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of Matth. Paris, who though he were no friend to this Pope, as I haue shewed before, yet ſpeaking of this Councell in the place aboue cited, ſaith thus: <hi>His omnibus congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatis in ſuo loco praefato, &amp; iuxta mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem Conciliorum Generalium in ſuis or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinibus ſingulis collocatis, facto prius ab ipſo Papa exhortationis ſermone, recitata ſunt in pleno Concilio capitula</hi> 60. (Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is a miſtake in the figure, it should be 70.) <hi>quae aliis placabilia, aliis vide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur oneroſa. Tandem de negotio Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixi &amp; ſubiectione terrae ſanctae verbum praedicationis exorſus, ſubiunxit di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens, Ad haec ne quid in negotio Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36392:138"/>Chriſti de contingentibus omitta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatur, volumus &amp; mandamus, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo repeats at large the ſubſtance of the Decree of the Expedition for the recouery of the Holy land. So that it is manifeſt by this, and that which hath beene ſayd before, that there were many things done in this Councell, yea all that are affirmed to bee. And it is called a Councell, and a generall Councell, by <hi>Vrſpergenſis, Paris, Platina, Grantzius, Nauclerus, Beluace<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſis,</hi> and all that I can finde that haue any way written therof, except your vncontrowlable ſelfe. Beſides it hath the allowance of the Holy Catholique Church, the awfull ſpouſe of Chriſt, more true, more wiſe, more vigilant, and infinitly more reuerend then all the ſects &amp; Synagogues of Schiſmatiques, &amp; Heretiques; &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s againſt her, whom they ought to belieue and reuerence aboue all things on the earth, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they are propounded peremptorily, as theſe are, are fitter to be reiected than to be anſwered.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36392:139"/>I conclude with the words of Surius: <hi>
                              <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Nemo ſanae mentis ambigere poteſt, hanc quae ſequitur Synodum Lateranenſem cum primis inſignem &amp; vere oecumenicam fuiſſe, quippe in qua de negotiis religionis ſumma Latinae &amp; Graecae Eccleſiae concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diâ tractatum eſt, cuique interfuere Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarcha Conſtantinopolitanus, &amp; Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſolymitanus, &amp; Archiepiſcopi tum La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni tum Graeci</hi> 70. <hi>Epiſcopi</hi> 412. <hi>Abbates &amp; Priores plus</hi> 800. <hi>ſimul omnes Praelati</hi> 1215. <hi>aut eo plures.

Quodſi verò ea cuiquam prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terea minus ponderis habere videatur, quod recentior ſit, ille certè Chriſtum mendacem facere velle videtur, qui per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennem praeſentiam ſuam promiſit Eccleſiae ſuae, &amp; Spiritum ſanctum ſuum, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum veritatis, qui cum illa maneat in aeternum.

                        <p>
                           <hi>No man well in his wits can doubt,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36392:139"/>that this Councell of Lateran was very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, and truly generall, becauſe therein were handled the matters of Religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with very great agreement of the Greeke and Latine Churches, &amp; wherin were preſent the Patriarch of Conſtantinople, and Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and</hi> 70. <hi>Archbishops Greeke and Latin, Bishops</hi> 412. <hi>Abbots and Priors aboue</hi> 800. <hi>all the Prelats together were one thouſand two hundred and fifteene, or more. Neither were there abſent the Ambaſſadours of the Greeke and Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Emperours, of the kings of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, France, Spayne, England, and others. But if this Councell ſeeme to any to haue leſſe weight, becauſe it is later, hee truly ſeemes to be willing to make Chriſt a lyar, who hath promiſed his perpetuall preſence to his Church, and his Holy Spirit, the Spirit of truth, which remayneth with her for euer? The autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Catholique Church doth alwayes abide here, which who ſoeuer preſumes to deſpiſe, he doth not leſſen her, but renders himſelfe worthy to be cruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to pieces with her weight.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>And now inſteed of your prouing
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36392:140"/>the Catholique writers lyars, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and the Catholique Church credulous, negligent, and ignorant (which you endeauoured) you haue proued your ſelfe, vnwiſe, vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and audacious; and I belieue will looſe all credit and reputation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, or capacity, in the iudgement of all prudent men, of what religion ſoeuer they be, that shall reade theſe your vnworthy workes. But ſuppoſe the thing it ſelfe were true, that you haue laboured for (abſtracting the authority to the contrary) to wit, that there had beene no Canons made in this Councell, yea ſuppoſe there had neuer beene any ſuch thing as this Councell, what is it to your purpoſe? What article of our Catholique Faith is therby cancelled? how is your inuiſible Church of England, or your Chappell in France (where God hath his Church) defended? Not at all, by ought that you haue ſayd. No nor by your Mimique acting of the prieſt in hearing of confeſſions, (which wee perhaps shall heare too, at the third

                        <p>And now let mee tell you, that it were much more for your credit, to forbeare ſuch bold brauing of the whole Catholique Church, eſpecially in a Catholique Country, and in the Court of a Catholique Queene, and

                        <p>And whereas one Mr Crowder hath reported, that I haue renounced the booke I lately ſet forth, and will not ſtand to it; and that Doctor Holden who approued it for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, hath alſo refuſed to iuſtify it; or words to this purpoſe; and giueth this for his reaſon, why hee doth not publish the anſwer which he and his Coadiutors (as it is ſayd) haue framed thereunto: which is indeed but a retreate for their inability to anſwer
